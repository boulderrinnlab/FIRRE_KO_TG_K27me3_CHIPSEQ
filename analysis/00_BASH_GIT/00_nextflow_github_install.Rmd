## Installing Nextflow

```{bash}

# goto home directory 
cd ~
ls -lah
# see if there is a directory called "bin"
# if not
mkdir bin
#if so
cd bin

# See nextflow documentation, the standard latest version can be installed by
wget -qO- https://get.nextflow.io | bash

# For an edge release: navigate to edge release installs on nextflow:
# https://github.com/nextflow-io/nextflow/releases

wget -q0 

```

## Adding nextflow to path

```{bash}

nano .bash_profile

# Add this line to .bash_profile

PATH=$PATH:~/bin

ctrl-x, y, return

# since we added a new program to the path during an existing session
# We need to either close the session and start a new one
# or source the new .bash_profile

source ~/.bash_profile

# to be sure it's working navigate somewhere out of your bin directory e.g., ~/
nextflow -version
# if it is in the path it will show you the version number anywhere and is executable anywhere

```

## connecting to github

1) Navigate to your git hub page > profile > settings > SSH and CPG keys

2) Navigate to your home directory on fiji

```{bash}
# Retrieve your private SSH key

cd .ssh
cat authorize_keys

# copy your key and paste into git hub SSH and CPG keys (new key button)

# To test if you are now connected try:

ssh -T git@github.com


```
