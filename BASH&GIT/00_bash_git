## The very first thing we need to do is make the github website communicate
with Fiji. Once this relationship is established, you don't need to do this again :)

Navigate to your home directory on fiji ~/IDENTIKEY

```
cd ~
ls -lah
```

Note that there is a .ssh folder that you can place these unique keys to let
servers communicate securely. We can check to see if a key already exists.
If it doesn't we will generate one with the with ssh-keygen command.

```
cd .ssh
ls -lah
# If it exists already, you can check out the public key using cat
cat id_rsa.pub
```


This will reveal the public ssh key for fiji. If we don't have a key in this file already,
let's create one:

```
ssh-keygen -t rsa
```
